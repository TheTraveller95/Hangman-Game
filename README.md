# The Hangman Game

This little and funny game was born from the custom in hanging the criminals who had been sentenced to death. These ones, before been killed 
could demand the "Rite of Words and Life." 
In the home pageof my project, you will find the story and explanation of this rite.
The game consists in guessin a word related to a determined topic, having as tips only the number of letters contained in it.
The player can try letter by letter in order to find the ones that actually compose the word to be guest.
Every time that the choosen letter is a wrong one, a piece of the hangman will be drawn down. The game ends if the palyer guesses the word 
before the entire hangman is drawn (in this case the palyer win) or, on the other hand, when the player drew the full hangman by choosing 7 wrong 
letters.

## UX

The main goal of this project is to let the users have fun by playing this funny game. The user does not need much time to play it because it
begins and ends every time he guesses the word or looses. It can be played during a bus riding or when waiting to be atended by the doctor.

In order to see some of this project mockups, please find them inside the Mockups folder.
